| 14.11.2023     | 5    | Tried to fix unicafe and the coverage for a long time - didn't seem to work - until I just used poetry shell , which is weird... |
| 21.11.2023     | 7    | I fixed the last weeks problems - got my .gitignore done, did the tehtava 1 and 2 (medmaid kaava), did the other exercise sucessfully. I have no yet done or done exercises with PyGame from https://ohjelmistotekniikka-hy.github.io/python/pygame, I will do that this week. I got the coverage working and the tests (I hope so?) - furthermore, the reason why all this took more time was because sometimes the VSCode didn't allow me to push a lot of the time to github with "Authentication failed. Some common reasons include:

- You are not logged in to your account: see File > Options.
- You may need to log out and log back in to refresh your token.
- You do not have permission to access this repository.
- The repository is archived on GitHub. Check the repository settings to confirm you are still permitted to push commits.
- If you use SSH authentication, check that your key is added to the ssh-agent and associated with your account.
- If you use SSH authentication, ensure the host key verification passes for your repository hosting service.
- If you used username / password authentication, you might need to use a Personal Access Token instead of your account password. Check the documentation of your repository hosting service." and I have no clue what do or how to fix it - I did generate a new SSH key but it sadly didn't work.... |
